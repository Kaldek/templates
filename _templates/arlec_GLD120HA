Tuya-Convert is the only realistic option for this bulb as the assembly is pressed and glued together.  The LED driver and power module is inserted into the white plastic base and glued into place.  The "globe" (basically a frosted clear plastic) is then glued into the plastic base.  As a result, if your firmware is too new for Tuya-Convert, the only remaining Tasmota option is to destroy the assembly and remove the ESP8266EX (TYWE3L) module for use in other projects.
